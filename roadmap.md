# Project Roadmap: AI Player for Heroes 3: HOTA

This document outlines the step-by-step plan to develop an AI player for Heroes 3: HOTA multiplayer mode.

---

## 1. Project Setup and Documentation
- **1.1** Create a Git repository for the project.
- **1.2** Add an initial `README.md` file outlining the project's goal and scope.
- **1.3** Include this roadmap as a separate file in the repository.
- **1.4** Ensure the repository is initialized and accessible for collaborative use.

---

## 2. Research and Planning
- **2.1** Study the game mechanics and AI behavior in Heroes 3: HOTA.
- **2.2** Research tools for AI vision, screen capture, and input simulation.
- **2.3** Explore Heroes 3 game files or reverse engineering methods for parsing game data (if legal and ethical).

---

## 3. AI Vision and Data Capture
- **3.1** Choose and set up a screen-capture framework (e.g., OpenCV, PyAutoGUI).
- **3.2** Create a system to identify and extract key game elements from the screen (e.g., hero positions, map objects, and UI elements).
- **3.3** Validate extracted data with test scenarios.

---

## 4. Game Understanding and Strategy
- **4.1** Map game rules and decision-making logic for basic AI behavior.
- **4.2** Create a data structure to represent the game state and evaluate AI options.

---

## 5. Integration and AI Algorithm Design
- **5.1** Implement a basic rule-based AI to interact with the game.
- **5.2** Incrementally integrate advanced AI algorithms (e.g., pathfinding, heuristic decision-making, machine learning).

---

## 6. Testing and Iteration
- **6.1** Test the AI in controlled scenarios and multiplayer matches.
- **6.2** Debug and optimize AI performance.

---

## 7. Refinement and Scaling
- **7.1** Enhance AI capabilities for more complex strategies.
- **7.2** Document progress and results in the Git repository.
