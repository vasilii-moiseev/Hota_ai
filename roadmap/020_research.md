# Research and Planning

## Goal
Gather information and tools needed to understand the game mechanics, AI requirements, and available technologies for screen capture, input simulation, and game data parsing.

## Steps
- [ ] **Study Game Mechanics and AI Behavior**:
  - Research how Heroes 3: HOTA handles AI decision-making and game logic.
  - Identify key aspects of the game that the AI player needs to understand (e.g., map navigation, combat strategies).

- [ ] **Research AI Vision and Screen Capture Tools**:
  - Evaluate tools like OpenCV and PyAutoGUI for screen capturing and detecting elements on the game screen.
  - Determine the feasibility of using these tools for real-time game vision.

- [ ] **Explore Input Simulation Techniques**:
  - Investigate libraries or APIs that simulate mouse clicks and keyboard inputs.
  - Identify the best approach to allow the AI to interact with the game through simulated inputs.

- [ ] **Investigate Game Data Parsing Options**:
  - Check for available resources, community insights, or tools that allow reading and interpreting game data.
  - Explore reverse engineering methods (if legally permissible) to understand game files and data structures.

## Expected Outcome
A clear understanding of the tools and methods needed to implement AI vision, simulate inputs, and potentially access game data. This research phase will lay the groundwork for building core AI functionalities.
