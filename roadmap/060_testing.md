# Testing and Iteration

## Goal
Thoroughly test the AI player in various scenarios to identify bugs, optimize performance, and refine behavior.

## Steps
- [ ] **Set Up Test Scenarios**:
  - Design specific game scenarios to test different aspects of the AI’s abilities (e.g., resource gathering, combat, navigation).
  - Create controlled conditions to assess the AI’s decision-making and action execution.

- [ ] **Test AI Behavior in Multiplayer Matches**:
  - Run the AI in actual multiplayer matches to observe how it performs against human players or other AIs.
  - Gather data on its strengths, weaknesses, and overall gameplay effectiveness.

- [ ] **Debug and Optimize Performance**:
  - Identify and resolve any bugs that appear during testing.
  - Optimize the AI’s code and algorithms for better performance and efficiency.

- [ ] **Iterate Based on Feedback**:
  - Refine the AI’s decision-making logic and strategies based on testing outcomes.
  - Repeat testing and optimization cycles until the AI behaves as desired in most scenarios.

## Expected Outcome
A reliable and optimized AI player capable of handling various game scenarios with consistent and effective behavior.
