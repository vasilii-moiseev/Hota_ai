# Game Understanding and Strategy

## Goal
Build a framework that enables the AI to understand the game state, make strategic decisions, and plan actions based on the current environment.

## Steps
- [ ] **Map Game Rules and Decision-Making Logic**:
  - Document key game rules and constraints relevant to the AI (e.g., movement rules, combat mechanics, resource management).
  - Identify which rules need to be explicitly programmed versus learned through AI behavior.

- [ ] **Create a Game State Representation**:
  - Design a data structure to represent the game state, including player positions, resources, and enemy data.
  - Ensure the data structure can be updated in real-time as the game changes.

- [ ] **Define Basic AI Strategies**:
  - Outline basic strategies that the AI can employ, such as exploration, resource gathering, and combat.
  - Start with simple rule-based strategies to test the AI's basic decision-making.

- [ ] **Integrate Game Understanding with AI Vision**:
  - Connect the game state representation with the data captured from the AI vision system.
  - Ensure that visual data updates the game state representation accurately and efficiently.

## Expected Outcome
A foundational system that allows the AI to interpret the game state and make decisions based on defined strategies, forming the basis for more complex AI behavior.
