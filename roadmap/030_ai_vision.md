# AI Vision and Data Capture

## Goal
Develop the AI's ability to "see" and understand the game screen by capturing and interpreting visual data from Heroes 3: HOTA.

## Steps
- [ ] **Set Up Screen Capture Framework**:
  - Implement a tool for capturing the game screen in real-time, such as OpenCV or PyAutoGUI.
  - Test screen capture to ensure reliable and consistent image acquisition from the game.

- [ ] **Identify Key Game Elements**:
  - Define the game elements that the AI needs to recognize (e.g., hero positions, map objects, resources, enemy units).
  - Capture sample screenshots and label the key elements for future recognition tasks.

- [ ] **Implement Element Detection**:
  - Use image processing techniques to detect and track specific game elements.
  - Experiment with template matching, color detection, or other methods to identify elements reliably.

- [ ] **Validate Captured Data**:
  - Test the element detection system under different game scenarios.
  - Ensure that the AI can consistently and accurately detect elements on the screen.

## Expected Outcome
A working screen capture and element detection system that allows the AI to identify important aspects of the game environment in real-time, forming the basis for its decision-making.
