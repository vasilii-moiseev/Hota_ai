# Integration and AI Algorithm Design

## Goal
Develop and integrate algorithms to control the AI’s actions based on its understanding of the game state, enabling it to perform tasks and respond to in-game situations.

## Steps
- [ ] **Implement Basic Rule-Based AI**:
  - Develop simple rule-based algorithms for basic actions, such as moving, gathering resources, and engaging in combat.
  - Test these rules to ensure the AI can perform fundamental actions accurately.

- [ ] **Incorporate Decision-Making Algorithms**:
  - Explore decision-making algorithms (e.g., Minimax for combat, heuristic-based navigation).
  - Implement these algorithms to allow the AI to make more complex choices based on the game state.

- [ ] **Pathfinding Integration**:
  - Implement a pathfinding algorithm, like A* or Dijkstra’s, to help the AI navigate the map efficiently.
  - Test the pathfinding to ensure the AI can reach objectives while avoiding obstacles.

- [ ] **Set Up Machine Learning for Adaptive Behavior** (Optional):
  - Explore machine learning algorithms to enable adaptive behavior, where the AI learns from previous actions.
  - Implement basic training models if feasible, or consider reinforcement learning for more advanced behavior.

## Expected Outcome
An integrated AI system with decision-making and pathfinding capabilities, allowing it to perform more sophisticated actions and respond intelligently to game scenarios.
